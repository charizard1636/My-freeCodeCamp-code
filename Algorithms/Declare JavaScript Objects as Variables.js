/* Declare JavaScript Objects as Variables 

Before we dive into Object Oriented Programming, let's revisit JavaScript objects.

Give your motorBike object a wheels, engines and seats attribute and set them to numbers.
*/

//Here is a sample Object
var car = {
  "wheels":4,
  "engines":1,
  "seats":5
};

//Now Let's make a similar Object called motorBike
//Give it two wheels, one engine and one seat
var motorBike = {
  // Only change code below this line.
  "wheels":2,
  "engines":1,
  "seats":1


  // Only change code above this line.
};

(function() {return JSON.stringify(motorBike);})();

/* Iterate with JavaScript While Loops 

You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

Another type of JavaScript loop is called a "while loop", because it runs "while" a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true.

var ourArray = [];
var i = 0;
while(i < 5) {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
Let's try getting a while loop to work by pushing values to an array.

Instructions

var myArray = [];
//Push the numbers zero through four to myArray
var i = 0;
while(i<5) {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
